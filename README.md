JFocusBoost
===========

JFocusBoost is a JavaFX implementation of a simple pomodoro timer.

At this moment it is in early development stage but some functionality is ready, including:

* Support for pomodoros and breaks
* Sound alerts
* :) is a simple pomodoro clock, you catch the idea right?

Requirements
============
* JVM SE 7
* or JVM SE 6 with JavaFx installed

At this time it does not work with OpenJDK, but OpenJDK support and JavaFX open sourcing it's planned, so await if you want to avoid the Java Trap
