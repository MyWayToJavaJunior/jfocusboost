At this moment it's in an early development stage but some functionality is ready, including:

* Support for pomodoros and breaks
* Sound alerts
* :) is a simple pomodoro clock, you catch the idea right?

Checkout the [download area](https://github.com/tuxtor/jfocusboost/downloads), at this alpha release the clock and the installer have been tested on linux

Requirements
